\title{Get the Crown Radius to Tree Diameter Ratio (m/cm)
This function does a simple calculation to get the ratio of the crown radius
 (m) to tree diameter (cm) of a particular species or subset of data. It
converts the starting DIA measurements back to inches, calculates according
to species specific parameters, then converts the crown radius from feet to
meters, and returns the ratio of crown radius to tree diameter in m/cm.}
\usage{
getC1(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{This is your target dataframe. It must have four columns: DIA, b0,
  b1, and b2. If your target species does not use one of the parameters, just
  set it to 0 to cancel it out.}
}
\value{
This function returns a single number, the mean crown ratio for the
  values you entered. Use the \code{\link{doFxBySort}} wrapper to get it for
  multiple species, e.g.,
  doFxBySort(getC1, "SPCD", c("DIA", "b0", "b1", "b2"), TreesCA)
}
\description{
The generalized equation that these parameters fit is as follows:
}
\details{
\deqn{CrownRadius = (b0 + b1*DIA  + b2*DIA^2)/2} where b0, b1 and b2 are
species-specific parameters. These were calculated extensively for our main
Sierra Nevada study species by Bechtold WA (2004) Largest-Crown-Width
Prediction Models for 53 Species in the Western United States. West J Appl
