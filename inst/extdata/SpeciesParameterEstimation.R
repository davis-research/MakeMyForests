### Data Generation Example
### Started 06/11/2015 by S.L.D. 

### This is an example code for generating species characteristics from FIA
### DataMart data. I will not be using the trimmed data included in 
### MakeMyForests, but instead show how one might generate the TreesCA data
### frame that is included with the package. Code intended to run only once is
### commented with one #.

### load MakeMyForests

#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
## install MakeMyForests

#install_github("ecology-rocks/MakeMyForests")
library(MakeMyForests)

#########  Generating "TreesCA" From Full Data  ##########

## Picking species shortcodes from USDA PLANTS Database
speciesShortCodes <- c("ABCO", "ABMA", "CADE27", 
                       "PIMO3", "PICO", "PIJE", 
                       "PIPO", "PILA", "PSME", 
                       "QUCH2", "QUKE")

## Getting the SPCD numbers for those species shortcodes: RefSpecies is
## REF_SPECIES.CSV from FIA datamart, included in the package.
speciesCodes <- pullSpeciesCodes(speciesShortCodes, 
                                 RefSpecies)

## Trim the table to make it more manageable. FullTreesCA is the CA_TREE.CSV
## file available at the FIA datamart.

trees <- pullTrees(speciesCodes, FullTreesCA, c("PLT_CN", "TREE", "STATUSCD", "SPCD", "DIA", "HT", "CR", "CDENCD", "TRANSCD", "BHAGE", "TOTAGE", "CLIGHTCD"))

#########  Generating Species Statistics From TreesCA ##########

## For ease, and consistency, we will use FullTreesCA, although "trees" as
## calculated above is the exact same.

## Start the "speciesInfo" dataframe, which will hold all of our final
## calculated variables for each species. Populate it with shortcodes for
## readability, spcd for reference numbers, calculate the maximum height for all
## records within a species, and make sure nothing enters as factors.
speciesInfo <- data.frame(shortcode=speciesShortCodes, 
                          SPCD=speciesCodes, 
                          H1=doFxBySort(max, "SPCD", "HT", TreesCA), 
                          stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

## To calculate H2 (Pacala et al. 1996), each tree needs its asymptotic (max)
## height, or potential height, in a column. So, we need to take that
## information from the speciesInfo table, and place it as a new column in
## TreesCA. Then, we can calculate H2 with putH2.
## Note: Need to unlist putChar because it returns a data.frame.
TreesCA$H1 <- unlist(putChar(TreesCA, speciesInfo[,c("SPCD", "H1")], "H1"))
speciesInfo$H3 <- doFxBySort(getH3, "SPCD", c("HT", "H1", "DIA"), TreesCA)


## C1 is the ratio of tree crown radius (m) to stem diameter (cm). To calculate 
## C1, we need both crown radius and stem diameter. Crown radius is a 
## measurement that can be difficult to take, so we have to rely on the 
## published literature instead of FIA data, which do not contain tree crown 
## radius measurements. I used published equations in Bechtold (2004) to relate 
## diameter to "largest crown width", or mean crown diameter, for each of the
## study species. I could then divide the two to get the ratio.

b0 <- c(4.4965, 4.7623, 4.1207,

        -0.0089, 0, -0.0109,
        0, 0)
speciesC1params <- data.frame(SPCD=unique(TreesCA$SPCD), b0=b0, b1=b1, b2=b2)

TreesCA$b0 <- unlist(putChar(TreesCA, speciesC1params[,c(1:2)], "b0"))
TreesCA$b1 <- unlist(putChar(TreesCA, speciesC1params[,c(1,3)], "b1"))
TreesCA$b2 <- unlist(putChar(TreesCA, speciesC1params[,c(1,4)], "b2"))


speciesInfo$C1 <- doFxBySort(getC1, "SPCD", c("DIA", "b0", "b1", "b2"), TreesCA)

## We can use the same function to calculate C2 and E1, just by referencing 
## different parts of the TreesCA dataframe.
## 
## C2 is the ratio of Crown Depth (m) to Tree Height (m), or the compacted crown
## ratio, which is already present in the FIA Inventory as "CR"
## 
## E1 is the "Light Extinction Coefficient" -- or the amount of light that penetrates the canopy to the ground. In the FIA data, it is estimated within 5% for each tree, in a column called TRANSCD

speciesInfo$C2 <- (doFxBySort(mean, "SPCD", "CR", TreesCA, extraParams=list(na.rm=TRUE)))/100
speciesInfo$E1 <- (doFxBySort(mean, "SPCD", "TRANSCD", TreesCA, extraParams=list(na.rm=TRUE)))/100

## This is a good place to save, if you need to. 
# write.csv(speciesInfo, file="speciesInfo.csv")

## Finding minimum adult DBH can be challenging. I was, however, able to find
## the minimum age of reproduction for my 11 species. So, to calculate minimum
## adult DBH, I performed a regression with DBH as the response variable and
## BHAGE as the predictor, then used that regression to predict new values of
## DBH. For each species, I plugged in the minimum adult age and calculated the
## new, estimated diameter. It's not perfect, but it's the best we have.

## Original minimum adult ages from literature searches.
speciesInfo$minAge <- c(40, 35, 10,
             7, 5, 8,
            16, 40, 15,
            20, 30)

TreesCA$minAge <- unlist(putChar(TreesCA, speciesInfo[,c("SPCD", "minAge")], "minAge"))
speciesInfo$minDBH <- doFxBySort(predictYfromLin, "SPCD", c("minAge", "DIA", "BHAGE"), TreesCA, extraParams=list(formula="DIA~BHAGE"))


## Finally, we need some information about trees growing in full-light and
## no-light condition. More specifically, we need the yearly diameter growth in
## no-light and high-light conditions. Unfortunately, data through time are not
## available for our study species. As an alternative, I decided to use the
## snapshot approach. For some trees in the FIA dataset, both BHAGE *and*
## CLIGHTCD will be filled out. CLIGHTCD is a rating system from 1-5, where 1
## means that the tree is totally shaded and 5 means that the tree is in full
## sun. Using these two extremes, we can look at diameter divided by age (to get
## the average diameter increase per year) in both no-light and full-light
## conditions.

## This just subsets the data into trees with both BHAGE and CLIGHTCD available, and also does some housecleaning by converting CLIGHTCD into a usable format, calculating dia/yr, etc.
LightedTrees <- prepLightData(TreesCA)

## Calculate growth at 0 light, 100 light, plus standard deviations. doSpecies
## is a function that is more specific than doFxBySort; it only calculates one
## of four possibilities. The bootstrapped mean, the bootstrapped standard
## deviation, the slope of a line, and the intercept of a line, all for these
## light data. Hopefully future versions of MakeMyForests will eliminate this
## redundancy and wrap the functions into a more general counterpart.
speciesInfo$YrlyDiaNoLt <- doSpecies(LightedTrees[LightedTrees$light==0,],
                                        "boot", "mean")
speciesInfo$YrlyDiaMaxLt <- doSpecies(LightedTrees[LightedTrees$light==100,],
                                         "boot", "mean")
speciesInfo$YrlyDiaNoLtSD <- doSpecies(LightedTrees[LightedTrees$light==0,],
                                        "boot", "sd")
speciesInfo$YrlyDiaMaxLtSD <- doSpecies(LightedTrees[LightedTrees$light==100,],
                                         "boot", "sd")
speciesInfo$SlopeYrlyGrowth <- doSpecies(LightedTrees, "glm", "slope")
speciesInfo$IntYrlyGrowth <- doSpecies(LightedTrees, "glm", "int")

## Finally, to calculate the maximum potential yearly diameter increase in high
## light, we take the mean + 2 sd to calculate a potential at 95% of possible
## values.
speciesInfo$MaxYrlyDia <- speciesInfo$YrlyDiaMaxLt + 2*speciesInfo$YrlyDiaMaxLtSD
